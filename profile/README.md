# About Relay

Relay was founded with the purpose of solving problems in DAO membership and debate, from seeing first-hand the issues of coordinating web3 while relying on centralized web2 messengers and identity.

The team was working to fix this problem by inventing a wallet messenger in the Elixir language, then very happily the beta release of XMTP in April solved many of the web3 communication needs.

Relayâ€™s goal is to provide open-source tools and products on top of XMTP, and create the best place for web3 identities to share, transact, and communicate. Today, use your wallet to chat with friends, groups, or anons now at relay.cc, and Receiver is coming soon to bring XMTP messaging to all your favorite web3 sites.
